HandWritten Digit Recognition: Digits written by humans vary a lot in curves and sizes as they are hand-drawn and everyoneâ€™s writing is not the same. It is a great way to start artificial intelligence by building a handwritten digits recognition system that can identify the digit drawn by humans.
